# Key steps in the BasClu framework


-- number of MCMC chains
--- number of iterations per chain
--- initial value of chains are "randomly sampled from overdispersed distributions
    based on the posterior distribution estimates from preliminary runs of the model."
--- Discard 300,000 samples as burn-in
--- Remaining are "thinned" -- collect every 10th sasample
--- Check convergence using "Gelman-Rubin Diagnostic"
--- Samples from all chains are combined for making inference
